    <h2>Day 7</h2>
    <p>July 27th, 2021</p>
    <img style="width: 85%;height: auto;" src="7.jpg" alt="candy day 7"/>
    <p>Made two trips, one during lunchtime and then one after coming back and using the restroom</p>
    <h2>Day 6</h2>
    <p>July 26th, 2021</p>
    <img style="width: 85%;height: auto;" src="6.jpg" alt="candy day 6" />
    <p>A colleague was in the break room when I made today's first pickup attempt. I don't know him very well. We had an awkward conversation about the weather and instead of digging for my favorite candies I skimmed some off the top. When I returned from lunch I grabbed some more candy while a bunch of people ate lunch.</p>
    <h2>Day 5</h2>
    <img style="width: 85%;height: auto;" src="5.jpg" alt="candy day 5" />
    <p>The tub of candy is becoming more saturated with M & Ms as I take my favorite candies.</p>
    <h2>Day 4</h2>
    <p>July 24th, 2021</p>
    <img style="width: 85%;height: auto;" src="4.jpg" alt="candy day 4" />
    <p>Another 100 Grand Bar, and a new addition to add extra color, an Almond Joy.</p>
    <h2>Day 3</h2>
    <p>July 23th, 2021</p>
    <img style="width: 85%;height: auto;" src="3.jpg" alt="candy day 3" />
    <p>Starting to get a stronger collection.</p>
    <h2>Day 2</h2>
    <p>July 22nd, 2021</p>
    <img style="width: 85%;height: auto;" src="2.jpg" alt="candy day 2" />
    <p>Grabbed 3 instead of 2 today because they were clearly visible through the mass of M & Ms</p>
    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>July 21st, 2021</p>
    <img style="width: 85%;height: auto;" src="1.jpg" alt="candy day 1" />
    <p>Day 1 starts as an accident. I take two candies home to enjoy later, but seeing them on my shelf I imagine a project.</p>
